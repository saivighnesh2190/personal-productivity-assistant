# ✅ Issue Fixed!

## The Problem
The frontend was built in production mode and trying to use `/api` endpoints, but nginx wasn't properly configured to proxy these requests to the backend container.

## The Solution
Updated `nginx.conf` to use the correct container names:
- Changed `http://backend:8080` to `http://productivity-backend:8080`

## Working Now!
✅ Registration works  
✅ Login works  
✅ API proxy is functioning  
✅ All services are connected  

## Test Account Created
You can login with:
- Username: `testuser123`
- Password: `password123`

Or create a new account at: http://localhost:3000/register

## Verify Everything Works
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Either login with the test account or register a new one
3. Start creating notes and tasks
4. Try the AI features (remember to add your Gemini API key in `.env` and restart the backend)

## Services Status
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000 ✅
- Backend API: http://localhost:8080 ✅  
- MySQL Database: localhost:3306 ✅
- API Proxy: http://localhost:3000/api/* → backend ✅

Everything is working correctly now!
